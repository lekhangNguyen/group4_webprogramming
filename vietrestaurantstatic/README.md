## Website Structure
The website consists of the following sections:

### Header
- Includes Logo/Icon, Navigation Bar, Search Form, and Shopping Cart.

### Main Body Sections
- **Home**
- **About**
- **Menu**
- **Product**
- **Review**
- **Contact**
- **Blog**

### Footer
- Includes Social Media Links, Back-to-Home Button, and Copyright Information.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Navigation:** The navigation bar allows users to access different sections of the website easily.
- **Clickable Buttons:** All static buttons are fully functional and provide a smooth browsing experience.
- **Animated Elements:** GIFs are used in the Home and About sections to enhance user engagement.
- **Pop-up Windows:** Interactive pop-ups are available for buttons in the Menu and Blog sections.
- **Form Validation:** The contact form requires valid input; otherwise, a pop-up notification alerts the user.

## Project Scope
Since this is a static website, the primary focus is on frontend design and HTML structure.

## Future Development Ideas
- **Blog Expansion:** Create individual pages for each blog post to enhance user experience and content readability.
- **Cart Icon Enhancement:** Modify the cart icon to visually indicate whether it is empty or contains items (suggested by Dr. Jawad).
